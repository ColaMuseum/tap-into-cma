Web-based mobile tour application for the Columbia Museum of Art.

Live tour: http://tours.columbiamuseum.org

Application allows the museum to offer an immersive multimedia (audio, video, imagery) expereince on in-house iPods and visitor devices.

We are trying to build a little admin area to facilitate tour additions and edits to the existing tours. Any help would be much appreciated.

I've connected the code in this repository to a sandbox database. I've also included a sql file if you want dump the tour data into a local database.

Send any questions or comments to jgoley@columbiamuseum.org or jgoley@gmail.com
